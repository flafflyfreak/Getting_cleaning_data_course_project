Course project  - Getting and Cleaning Data

The repository contains the R script for the course project and the codebook to understand the data set created by the script. 

The R script is called run_analisis.R and it allows to create a new, tidy, data set from the ones provided.
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

The task was creating an R script that does the following: 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set created above, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The code book, called CodeBook.md, describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed.
